# Seatsomatic - Seats Lecture code python script for University of Nottingham

This python script automatically opens a window with your seats lecture qr code 15 minutes before the start of the lecture. 

You need to run it with the first argument being your teaching timetable iCal link which you can get from:

https://mycal.nottingham.ac.uk/login

When the script starts, it shows a list of lectures in your calendar. If you click on one it will open the QR code window. Otherwise it will auto-open in an on-top window once the lecture starts.
